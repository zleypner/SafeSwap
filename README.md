### Managing Dependencies and Running Specific Applications

### Adding Dependencies

If you need to add a dependency to any of the applications within the monorepo, you must navigate to the respective application directory and then install the dependency from there.
    
### Running Specific Applications

Run individual applications directly from the root directory:

1. **Frontend**:
    
    ```bash
    npm run dev:frontend
    ```
    
2. **backend**:
    
    ```bash
    npm run dev:backend
    ```

### Applications in the Monorepo

The monorepo contains the following applications:

1. **Frontend (Next.js)**
    - Description: The frontend application built with Next.js, providing the user interface for the project.
    - Path: apps/frontend
2. **Backend (Nest.js)**
    - Description: The backend application built with Nest.js, handling business logic and APIs to interact with the frontend and other services.
    - Path: apps/backend

## 📚 Documentation

For more details on each of the applications, please refer to the respective README files:

- [Frontend Documentation](apps/frontend/README.md)
- [Backend Documentation](apps/backend/README.md)

### How It Works

1. **Listing a Product**: Sellers can create listings for products. Each listing includes information such as price, description, and images.
2. **Making a Purchase**: Buyers can select a product and initiate a purchase. Funds are transferred to an escrow account on the Stellar blockchain.
3. **Escrow Release**: Upon completion of the agreed-upon conditions, the Trustless Work API triggers the release of funds to the seller’s Stellar account.
